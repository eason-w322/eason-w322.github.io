      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, I explore <b>image warping</b> and <b>mosaicing</b> to create seamless panoramas
        from multiple photographs. The goal is to recover homographies between images, warp them
        using nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation, and blend them into smooth mosaics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project consists of four main parts:
        (A.1) Shooting pictures, (A.2) Recovering homographies,
        (A.3) Warping images, and (A.4) Blending them into mosaics.
      </p>
    </section>

  <h2>A.1 – Shoot and Digitize Pictures</h2>
  <p>
    I captured multiple photo sets by rotating the camera about a fixed center of projection
    to create projective transformations suitable for mosaicing. Each image overlaps the next
    by about 50–60% to ensure reliable feature matching and homography estimation.

  <p class="notes">
    The sequence above illustrates a panorama obtained by rotating the camera horizontally
    about its optical center. The images show consistent perspective and lighting,
    which helps in computing a smooth homography and blending in later steps.
