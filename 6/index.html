    <h2>Part A — Question 0: Playing with DeepFloyd</h2>

    <h3>Text Prompts Used for Prompt Embeddings</h3>

    <p>
      To explore the behavior of the DeepFloyd diffusion model, I generated prompt embeddings
      for a diverse set of text prompts ranging from highly detailed, imaginative scenes to
      very simple object-level descriptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The prompts are intentionally ordered from <b>more complex</b> to <b>more minimal</b>.
      Complex prompts test the model’s ability to synthesize multiple concepts, spatial
      relationships, and artistic styles, while simpler prompts serve as controlled baselines
      for later experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, several prompt <b>pairs</b> were designed specifically for use in later
      sections involving <b>Hybrid Images</b> and <b>Visual Anagrams</b>, where semantic
      blending or transformation-based ambiguity is required.
